# 2DoF Hybrid Test Bench Digital Twin
This is a project for Engineering of Digital Twins course.
It models a Hybrid Test Bench with two Degrees of Freedom (2DoF), which is used as both a digital twin and an emulator of a physical twin.
The digital twin has recording, visualisation, monitoring and calibration services.
