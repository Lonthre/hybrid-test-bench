In order to run the simulations you need to run the YaFEM in this repository (yafem-0.2.6). 

**Run the following command:**

```
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```

If you have any problems try uninstalling your local yafem installation first:

```
pip uninstall yafem
```

Press Y and Enter. Run the following code again.

```
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```

Your simulation should work now - try running it.
